# 👨‍🍳‍ TokenChef

Cook a token in a few clicks and spice it up with an opportunity to get a share of transaction fees (powered by [Mode SFS](https://www.mode.network/)).

## 🔗 Artifacts

- Application - [tokenchef.vercel.app](https://tokenchef.vercel.app/)

  - Registry - [0x306FC512C947c66b00b3436C74c85d163a89C5Aa](https://sepolia.explorer.mode.network/address/0x306FC512C947c66b00b3436C74c85d163a89C5Aa)

1. Connect wallet.
2. Select the type, name, symbol, and other features of the token you want to launch.
3. Approve transaction and get a token deployed on the Mode Network.
4. Open the launched token on the page with all your tokens:
   - Add token to Metamask.
   - Execute token contract functions (Transfer, Mint, Pause, etc.).
   - Withdraw earnings received from Mode SFS.

## ⚒️ How it's made

## 🔮 What's next
